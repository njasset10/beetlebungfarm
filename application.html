                                The Farm Manager will manage all aspects of our production and distribution, with training and support from the Farm Director. Our Manager will be participating in the foundational first year as our organization takes on the stewardship of this historic farm.

Field tasks are mostly done by hand and will include greenhouse propagation, transplanting, seeding, weeding, irrigating, cultivating, harvesting, washing and general field maintenance. This will be a production focused position, but as our farm is in a central location of our community and has an active farm stand with many visitors, the Farm Manager will need to be flexible in scheduling daily tasks to accommodate the community and other farm programs as they develop. Additionally a freedom to bring new ideas, outside expertise and continuing education is encouraged.                            </p>
